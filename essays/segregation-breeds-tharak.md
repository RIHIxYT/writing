# Segregation Breeds Tharak

Sometimes I look around and wonder how we ended up like this—why so many guys in our society act like they’ve never seen a girl before. The way some of them talk, stare, obsess… it genuinely disgusts me. I’ve heard things said about girls that made me feel embarrassed to even be standing next to those people, and honestly, it’s the kind of talk that would make me embarrassed to even be born and breathe as a girl in such an environment. And sadly, a lot of it isn’t even seen as weird—it's normalized, laughed off, or brushed off.

I don’t think girls are objects or targets or some kind of mystery to chase. They’re just people. Classmates. Friends. And that’s how I’ve always treated them. Of course, having a crush is entirely normal; that's a part of being human. But seeing a woman and acting like you’ve just witnessed a UFO, is just not it.

Growing up in coeducational environments, I never thought twice about sitting next to a girl, helping her out in class, or just having a casual laugh. It was natural. Normal. Just as it should be. There was no agenda. But even in coed schools, I saw guys who still acted weird and made things uncomfortable. That’s when I realized it’s not just about whether you study in a boys-only or coed school—it’s about *tarbiyat*, how you’re raised, what you’re taught to value.

I’m the kind of person who’d be friends with every girl in class, and not once would I think about it in a “romantic” or “flirty” way. To me, that’s what true respect looks like—the kind that should be the absolute norm: not distancing yourself from someone because she’s a girl, and not getting close because you’re chasing something either. Just treating her like you would any other person—openly, kindly, and as an equal.

And yet, the moment you say this out loud in our society, some people look at you like you’re the weird one. Like you’re being “too soft” or “modern” or whatever label they want to throw at you. A simple friendship or even a normal interaction between a male and a female is made out to be a big deal, even though it shouldn't be far from the norm. But I stand by this. I’ll protect this mindset and speak up for it, even if it makes me the odd one out.

Because this hyper-conservative, segregated approach to gender? It’s done more harm than good. It’s created a generation of guys who never learned how to talk to girls like human beings. Who see every girl as either a “future wife” or someone off-limits. And because of that, we now have *tharki* behavior everywhere: in schools, on the internet, and in daily conversations on the street.

If we really want to fix this, we have to start by letting boys and girls interact like normal people again. Respectfully. Casually. Freely. The way it’s supposed to be. Not everything has to be wrapped in suspicion, shame, or desire. Sometimes, it’s just friendship. Just kindness. Just being decent.

And if that makes me seem “too different” or “too soft” in the eyes of some people—then so be it. I’d rather be different than part of the problem.
